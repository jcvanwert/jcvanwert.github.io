subtitle: Like most, I want the science that I do to make an impact. During my PhD, I gained  perspective through collaborations and sharing my research/scientific journey and highlight this below.

#### collaborations

I've been fortunate to have worked with brilliant minds from across the globe. I value each and everyone's perspective that has been influential to my career and personal development.

#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("phd-metrics/map/map_collabs.png")


```

#### dissemination

What is knowledge if it isn't shared? Not only do I care about sharing my scientific findings, but it is important to share my experiences. Below are some ways I've shared my scientific journey, perspective, and science throughout my PhD.

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("phd-metrics/plots/presentations.png")

```

The metrics above are inspired by [Phoebe Racine](https://www.phoeberacine.com/).
