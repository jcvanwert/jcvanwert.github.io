## Growth and gratitude

There is no easy way to acknowledge those who have been oppressed by my actions or inactions. I hope to demonstrate my sincerity and gratitude despite this virtual platform. As a scholar and European descendant, I have benefited from the systemic oppression, exclusion, and erasures of Indigenous peoples across North American lands. I am located in central coastal California and work and live on the unceded ancestral lands and waters of the Chumash people. I am grateful for the generations of Chumash people who have stewarded these lands and waters that I use today for life, work, and recreation. I am committed to continue learning about the systemic oppression and work towards a more equitable system. I aim to promote the work of oppressed voices and collaborate across community members and stakeholders, with the shared goals to conserve our natural resources. I invite all feedback and remain open minded as I develop into the scientist that I want to be.

An important first step is for us to understand the Native Land and history in which we work and live. This interactive [map](https://native-land.ca/) may be useful to you.

## Moments

I am no professional, but I try to capture some beauty that I see.
