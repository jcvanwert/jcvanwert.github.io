Corals and reef fish are both particularly near the edge of their thermal limits, threatening the health of coral reef ecosystems. The goal of these studies are to better understand the importance of fish in coral reefs and their plastic responses to marine heatwaves. I use nutrient analyses, respirometry, behavioral surveys, and cardiac thermal tolerance tests.\n\n\n\n\n\nObserving fish on the forereef in Moorea, French Polynesia."
