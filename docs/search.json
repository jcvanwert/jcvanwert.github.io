Corals and reef fish are both particularly near the edge of their thermal limits, threatening the health of coral reef ecosystems. The goal of these studies are to better understand the importance of fish in coral reefs and their plastic responses to marine heatwaves. I use nutrient analyses, respirometry, behavioral surveys, and cardiac thermal tolerance tests.\n\n\n\n\n\nObserving fish on the forereef in Moorea, French Polynesia."

It started off with a childhood in the woods and backyard, a yearning for sunshine and warmth, and a few dedicated teachers at Santa Barbara City College. During my CC days, I had my first research experience at UC Santa Barbara studying raccoon parasites with at the time, graduate student Sara Weinstein. I loved the process of science and wanted more, and was awarded an NSF REU at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole. I worked with Dr. Allen Mensinger on toadfish bioacoustics. At the time, I had no idea fish vocalized! I spent several additional summmers studying toadfish neurophysiology and was hooked to physiology.\nI wanted to merge my scientific background with my desire to learn and conserve vulnerable systems. That brought me to UC Santa Barbara where I earned my PhD at UC Santa Barbara with Dr. Erika Eliason."
