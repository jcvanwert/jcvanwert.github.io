## Pacific Salmon

In short, I assess the vulnerability of various species of Pacific salmon to changing river conditions (warm waters, various flow rates) to protect and conserve this threatened species. In collaboration with various stakeholders, I use a variety of techniques including blood physiology, enzyme and metabolite metrics, histology, respirometry, and tagging and tracking.

## Coral reef fish

On the other side of the equator and in very different clothing, I work with coral reef fish. Coral reef ecosystems are facing extreme temperatures. Corals and reef fish are both particularly near the edge of their thermal limits, threatening the health of coral reef ecosystems. The goal of these studies are to better understand the importance of fish in coral reefs and their plastic responses to marine heatwaves. I use nutrient analyses, respirometry, behavioral surveys, and cardiac thermal tolerance tests.

## Fisheries

I recently was awarded funding by NSF to work with [NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/pacific-islands-fisheries-science-center) to assess various management strategies on incidental by-catch of protected species. More to come!
